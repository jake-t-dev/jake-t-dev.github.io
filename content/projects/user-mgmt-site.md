![Profile Page](/user-mgmt-system/profile-page.png#center)

A simple User Profile Management System built to further develop my confidence in building applications using Go and HTMX.

## Project Background

I built this web application while completing the "HTMX + Go: Build Fullstack Applications with Golang and HTMX" Udemy course by [Fikayo Adepoju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fikayoadepoju/), which i was taking to further upskill in working with HTMX and Go templating, which are technologies I have been working with during my placement year at DailyPay.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jake-t-dev/user-mgt-system
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd user-mgt-system
```

Ensure the MySQL image (`mysql:latest`) is running in a Docker container

``` bash
  docker ps
```

Start the server

```bash
  go run main.go
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000)

## Features

### Account Creation

![Register](/user-mgmt-system/register-page.png#center)

Using this login page the user is able to create an account, this will create a row with the following field in the `users` table

```
- id: the autogenerated uuid for the user

- email: the user's email

- password: the user's password, hashed using bcrypt

- name: the user's full name

- category: represents the user's permission level

- dob: a date of birth field that can be edit and set by the user

- avatar: the file name of the user's avatar
```

### Session Management

![Login](/user-mgmt-system/login-page.png#center)

I used session cookies to allow users to login and logout of the system and maintain the same session from anywhere in their browser

### Profile Customisation

![Edit Profile](/user-mgmt-system/edit-profile.png#center)

User's are able to use the Edit Profile page to update several aspects of their profile

![Upload Avatar](/user-mgmt-system/upload-avatar.png#center)

They are also able to upload their own avatar to display on their profile, this is stored with the user's uuid as the file name ensuring we only store up to one profile image per user
